What data does my scripts need to generate HTML file for one directory:
	- A table of authors with their color id, name, token number, token proportion, commit number, commit proportion
	- A list of author names sorted alphabetically
	- Stats for current directory such as: total author number, total token number and total commit number 
	- A list of other directories (subdirectory):
		for each subdirectory:
			1. A table of trimmed authors with their color id, name, token number, token proportion
			2. A table of trimmed dategroup Data which contains hashes of date and each hash contains arrays of authors and their corresponding tokens created in that date
			3. Stats such as total file number and total line number under that directory, and total author number
			4. Width of its graph for each subdirectory
	- A list of files:
		for each file:
			1. A table of trimmed authors (same as subdirectory)
			2. A table of trimmed dategroup Data (same as subdirectory)
			3. Stats such as line number and author number 
			4. Two widths of its graph for each file, one is for the relationship between files and subdirectories and one is only between files
	- A breadcrumb array:
		to show a list of clickable parent paths on browser
	- The earlest and latest time of commits current directory has. For creating a range of selector for dates 


Algorithms:

Per file activity table : contains every commits under every file in a git repository with their author and tokens created.
example :
filename|personid|personname|commit|tokens|autdate

Per file dategroup table: a table with a group of dates along with authors who has created commits on that date and how many tokens he or she has created
example:
filename|dategroup|personid|personname|tokens

Before processing directories, it is optional to update the activity and dategroup table.

def print_single_dirs:
	String $dirpath - the directory path to be processed
	
	# The table tmp is cleaned and re-used every time the code gets in here
	create a table of authors with their id, color id, personname, tokens, token proportion, commit, and commit proportion for $dirpath and store it into table tmp
	
	get table of trimmed authors with their stats from table tmp
	get stats such as total author number, total commit number, total token number from table tmp for current directory 
	
	int $width - the max number of tokens among files and subdirectories under the current directory 
	int $widthForFiles - the max number of tokens 
	array $dirList - list of directories
	array $fileList - list of files
	
	for list of that contains the path for files and subdirectories under current directory:
		String $path - the path of current item
		
		if ($path is directory):
			get table of trimmed authors with their color id, token number, and token proportion 
			get trimmed dategroup data 
			get stats such as line number, file number, token number, and author number
			push it into the $dirList
		else if ($path is file):
			get trimmed authors
			get trimmed dategroup data
			get stats such as line number, token number, and author number
			push it into the $fileList
			compare and update the $widthForFiles
		
		compare and update the $width 
	
	update $width and $widthForFiles to both directories and files in $dirList and $fileList
	
	generate directory view using HTML::Template
	
def print_recursive_dirs:
	String $dirPath - the starting path of directory
	
	print_single_dirs($dirPath);
	
	for a list of directories under current directory:
		String $path - directory path of current item
		print_recursive_dirs($path);
